•	Cut paneer into long (thick) uniform pieces.
•	To prepare the coating, mix Kashmiri red chili powder, salt, ginger garlic paste, chat masala and tomato ketchup with soya sauce and corn flour.
•	Make a smooth paste of it. Add a little bit of water to for a medium smooth consistency.
•	Now coat the paneer pieces with the paste covering every inch of the pieces. For better coating, sprinkle about 2 tbsp of corn flour on the coated paneer pieces to prevent the coating to spread out while frying.
•	Let it rest for about 10 minutes.
•	Meanwhile, boil some water to prepare the noodles.
•	Pour noodles into it the pan. Let it cook for 2 minutes and then strain the water. Pour ice cubes/cold water over it to prevent over-cooking.
•	Now carefully roll the paneer with noodles.
•	Take one piece of paneer and few noodle strands and roll the strands over the paneer piece in a uniform way. Repeat the process for all the paneer pieces.
•	Now take a wok and heat desi ghee in it over high flame. Make sure it is flaming hot before cooking the paneer pieces as the noodles might absorb more ghee than expected.
Once the wok is sufficiently hot, place the paneer pieces one by one and fry till they turn golden brown. Serve hot.
